Problems Problem 1

Different variations of types int and float exist in C++ and other languages. They are usually limited by minimum and maximum values. Sometimes it is desired to have versions of these types with unlimited bounds. Java solves this problem by providing BigInteger and BigDecimal classes. In this problem it is required to develop a new C++ type (class) that can hold unlimited decimal integer values and performs arithmetic operations on them. You will develop in C++ a class, BigInt that supports writing

statements with extremely long integer values like these:

BigInt num1(‚Äú123456789012345678901234567890‚Äù); BigInt num2(‚Äú113456789011345678901134567890‚Äù); BigInt num3 = num2 + num1;

cout &lt;&lt; ‚Äúnum1 = ‚Äù &lt;&lt; num1 &lt;&lt; endl;

cout &lt;&lt; ‚Äúnum2 + num1 = ‚Äù &lt;&lt; num3 &lt;&lt; endl;

Your task is:

<ol>
<li>(1) &nbsp;Design the class BigInt that has the following public interface (set of operations available
to use by developers using the class): [18 points, 3 points for each function]

BigInt (string decStr); // Initialize from string and rejects bad input BigInt (int decInt); // Initialize from integer

BigInt operator+ (BigInt anotherDec);

BigInt operator= (BigInt anotherDec);

Int size();

You will also need to overwrite the &lt;&lt; operator as follows:

friend ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (ostream&amp; out, BigInt b)

Using data encapsulation, you are free to store the digits of the big decimal integer in whatever container you like. You might store them in an array, a vector, a string or whatever. These are details that are not important to the user of your class. You will need to build + and ‚Äì operations that work on the representation you chose.
</li>
<li>(2) &nbsp;Implement the class BigInt and write five test cases (including ‚Äìve numbers) to test it. Implement a program that runs the test cases and verifies the result. [7 points, 2 for each test case and 2 for the class]</li>

(1) First, develop a class Fraction that represents a fraction by one integer divided by

another, e.g.,1/3 or 3/7. [24 points]

<li>(7) &nbsp;Then develop a MatrixCalculator class which offers the user a menu of operations to perform on int matrices as follows. Each of these options should be able to accept matrices of varying dimensions, which the user inputs.

(8) Name a folder ‚ÄúA1_P3_ID1_ID2‚Äù and put your files inside it (even if it‚Äôs only one file) Problem 4 [5 points]

The given function ListPermutations below prints all the permutations of a given string. It is required to modify this function so that it only prints unique strings. The current function will do exhaustive recursion to calculate all permutations. So, if the given string has duplicate characters, the output will have duplicate words. For example, if it is given the string ‚ÄúMakka‚Äù, it will print ‚ÄúMkkaa‚Äù four times. Try this function and see how it works.

It is required to change the code so that it only prints unique combinations formed from the characters of the string. So for the above mentioned example, it should print ‚ÄúMkkaa‚Äù once.

Hint. To solve this, all what you need is storing each new word you form. Before printing a new word or storing it, check if it is not already stored. You will need an array, a vector or a set to store the words formed so far.

Problem 7 [

If you have a list of songs in a music library and want to sort this list alphabetically. However, you want songs with the title ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù to always appear at the top. Write a function called BiasedSort that accepts a vector by reference and sorts the songs according to the explained rules above.

Name a folder ‚ÄúA1_P7_ID1_ID2‚Äù and put your files inside it (even if it‚Äôs only one file)

Problem 8

Insertion sort uses linear search to find the right place for the next item to insert. Would it be faster to find the place using binary search (reduce number of comparisons)? We still must shift 1 item at a time from the largest till the right place. Use binary search on the already sorted items to find the place where the new element should go and then shift the exact number of items that need to be shifted and placing the new item in its place. The algorithm works the same, except that instead comparing and shifting item by item, it will compare quickly using binary search but it will still shift one by one till the right place (without comparison).

1) Plot the performance of the algorithm against the original insertion sort.

2) Name a folder ‚ÄúA1_P8_ID1_ID2‚Äù and put your files inside it (even if it‚Äôs only one file)

Problem 9

In this problem, we will develop classes to use for testing two sorting algorithms (Selection and Quick sort). The class will have methods to support experimenting and analyzing sorting algorithms performance. Below is a high-level UML diagram for your classes. Add any missing details. Testbed class has the following functions that you should complete:

Problem 10 [

In this problem, you should develop a linked list class similar to that provided in the C++ STL.

The public interface of your class should provide basic insertion and deletion functions. In addition, it should provide an iterator class as an inner class in order to access the data stored in the list. For example, if we have a list of three elements, and want to access the second element, we should declare an iterator and initialize it to the position of the first element, and move to the second position as shown in the code below:

<pre>list&lt;int&gt; myList;
myList.push_back(1);
myList.push_back(2);
myList.push_back(3);
list&lt;int&gt;::iterator it = myList.begin();
it++;
</pre>
cout&lt;&lt; *it;

notice the usage of the scope operator in the declaration of the iterator, this is because the iterator class is defined as an inner class inside the list class:

<pre>template&lt;class type&gt;
class myList {
public:
class iterator {
</pre>
// your code for the iterator class here };

// your code for the list class here

};

Your list class should be a template class. [3 points]

The list class should have the following public interface:

‚Ä¢ list() ‚Äì default constructor. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ list(type value, int initial_size) ‚Äì constructs a list having ‚Äòinitial_size‚Äô elements whose values are ‚Äòvalue‚Äô. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ ~list() ‚Äì a destructor to clear the list and leave no memory leaks. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ int size() ‚Äì returns the current number of elements in the list. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ void insert(type value, iterator position) ‚Äì adds an element at position specified by the iterator. For example, if the passed iterator currently points to the second element, this element will be shifted on position, and the new value should be added at the second position. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ iterator erase(iterator position) ‚Äì erases the element specified by the iterator and return an iterator to the next element, throws exception if position points after

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
‚Ä¢ list&lt;type&gt;&amp; operator = (list&lt;type&gt; another_list) ‚Äì overloads the assignment operator to deep copy a list into another list and return the current list by reference. [4 points]

‚Ä¢ iterator begin() ‚Äì returns an iterator pointing to the first element. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ iterator end() ‚Äì returns an iterator pointing after the last element. [3 points]

You should develop an iterator class the following public interface:

‚Ä¢ void operator ++ () ‚Äì overloads the operator ++, it should advance the iterator one position towards the end of the list, throws exception if it is currently pointing after the last element. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ void operator ‚Äî () ‚Äì overloads the operator ‚Äì, it should move the iterator one position toward the beginning of the list, throws exception if it is currently pointing to the

first element of the list. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ type&amp; operator * () ‚Äì overloads the dereference operator to return the value contained in the current node by refence to allow its modification. [3 points]

‚Ä¢ bool operator == (const iterator &amp;) ‚Äì overloads the equality comparison operator, should return true if the passed operator points to the same node. [3 points]

All node pointers in the list class of the iterator class should be private and inaccessible from outside of the class. [3 points]

No memory leaks or dangling pointers. [3 points]

It is highly recommended to implement it as a double linked list, however, it is up to you.

As mentioned above, our .end() function should return an iterator pointing to a position after the last element as the STL .end() function does. This can be done easily by having a dummy node after the actual tail, this dummy node contains no data, but mark the end of the list. So, physically, our list is never empty, which will ease the implementation of insertion and remove operations, as now we don‚Äôt have to handle an ‚Äúempty list‚Äù case. However, this dummy node should be disregarded when we return the size.

Write a main function to test all the above
